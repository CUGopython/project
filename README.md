# Web Crawling Project

Our project consists of 2 parts, both based on Python. In the first part, we obtain thousands of Columbia University images by crawler and then merge these images to create a mosaic image using a software called "Foto-Mosaik-Edda".  In the second part, we make a UI system for searching quant programs information. We get the quant programs information by crawler and make it a UI system by ?. In this UI, user can?
